<H2>Data Cleaning</H2>
<H3><i>Step By Step Process</i></H3>
<p>A raw file with <b>10100</b> rows of data was provided to us. We performed the data cleaning tasks to standardize the data. At last, we get a proper dataset with <b>9900</b> rows.
</p>
The steps taken to clean the clutter are as follows:
<ul>
1) The Auto fit is applied to the dataset.
 <br>
2) The Table was created with proper Headings.
 <br>
3) The Empty rows were deleted with filters.
  <br>
4) The Data Entries, Spelling, and Values were corrected.
  <br>
5) The Text to Column was used to split the data into multiple columns.
  <br>
6) The Date Column was Standardized.
</ul>
<H2>Calculated Columns</H2>
<H3><i>Step By Step Process</i></H3>

</p>
<ul>

  <br>

  <br>
3) Discount Segments Created
  <br>
